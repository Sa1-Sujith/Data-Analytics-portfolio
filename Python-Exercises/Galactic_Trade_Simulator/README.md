Galactic Resource & Trade Simulator: A Python-based Space Economy Simulation 

🌌 Project Overview:
This project simulates a complex space-economy environment where the user acts as the commander of a Starship (GQT-EXCELSIOR). The goal is to manage resources, trade commodities, and maintain critical survival supplies while navigating a fluctuating market.

🛠️ Technical Concepts Demonstrated:

--> Object-Oriented Design: Utilizes Market and Starship classes to encapsulate data and behaviors.

--> Dynamic Market System: Simulates real-time price fluctuations for resources like Food, Fuel, Gold, and Medical Supplies.

--> Survival Mechanics: Implements strict thresholds for Food and Fuel; dropping below these levels results in a "System Failure" and mission termination.

--> Dual-Currency Economy: Manages transactions using both standard Credits and premium Tokens.

--> Mining Expeditions: Consume Food and Fuel to discover Minerals.

--> Mineral Exchange: Trade Minerals directly for premium Tokens.

--> Gold Acquisition: Use premium Tokens to acquire high-value Gold assets.
